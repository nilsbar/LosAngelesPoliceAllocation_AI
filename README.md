# LosAngelesPoliceAllocation_AI
This repository contains a project that aims to build a deployable ML model to help allocate police resources in the LA area.



The training data can assessed under:
https://data.lacity.org/


Discussion about the training data:


- Data gathering: I tried to get all data which is connected which could be helpful to predict the required police ressources. The function of the police is to fight criminalism thus I took the Crime data and every LAPD call should be covered by the Police even if it is not a crime.  


- The optimal case would be if the required police strength for a crime delict/LAPD call would be delivered too.


- Problem: no realistical estimation for police strength, no morse codes known
